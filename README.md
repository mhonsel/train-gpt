This is a repository to follow along with the Andrej Karpathy's [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU) to reproduce GPT-2. Most of the code mirrors what's in his corresponding [build-nanogpt](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt/tree/master) GitHub.

I integrated some of the proposed fixes and refactored and cleaned up the code a little bit.
